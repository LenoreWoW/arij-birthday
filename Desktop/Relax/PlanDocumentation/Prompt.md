Relaxify

I want to build a cross-platform (iOS & Android + web admin) booking app that helps both end-customers and spa/salon owners unify discovery, scheduling, and payments for beauty & relaxation services. It should feel clean, modern, and effortless—optimized for mobile-first experiences and a complementary web dashboard for merchants.

• Map view and list view toggles showing nearby spas/salons
• Smart filters for service type, price range, rating, distance
• Quick “search by name” bar and featured/promoted merchants

• Service management: define service names, durations, prices, staff assignments, buffer times, and add-ons
• View upcoming bookings, accept/reject requests, and manage cancellations

#### ✅ **Notifications & Marketing**

• Automated reminders (24 hrs and 1 hr before), follow-up “thank you” messages, and review requests
• Bulk SMS/email campaigns (e.g., birthday promotions) with free monthly quota
• In-app chat or FAQ widget for pre-booking questions

#### ✅ **Analytics & Reporting**

• Dashboards for daily/weekly/monthly bookings and revenue (bar/line charts)
